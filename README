How to run tgn training:

1. Use tgn_paper.ipynb in colab
2. Notebook will create "data" directory. Please upload "wikipedia.csv" file in data directory with exact name.
3. The notebook will automatically load data from this fiel during execution while executing.
4. With all above steps you will be able to run pre_process data. It takes raw .csv interaction logs and processes them to generate .npy (NumPy binary) files for faster access and efficient training.
5. If you start running training on the cloned code, it will fail with below error:
         TypeError: Population must be a sequence. For dicts or sets, use sorted(d).
6. Open utils/data_processing.py, and go to line where random.sample() is used (line 81).
7. Make below change: 
From : - new_test_node_set = set(random.sample(test_node_set, int(0.1 * n_total_unique_nodes)))
To : - new_test_node_set = set(random.sample(sorted(test_node_set), int(0.1 * n_total_unique_nodes)))
8. With this, the training should go fine.



How to run visualization:
1. load TGN_graph_animation.ipynb
2. All you need to do is to load the "ml_wikipedia_s.csv" file in data. 
3. Run the whole code from colab and it should start showing visualization.

How to see Demo:
1. Open huggingface demo site app.
2. Sart playing with various inputs.
